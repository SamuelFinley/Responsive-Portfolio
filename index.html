                    Hello! My name is Samuel Finley-Price. I was born and have lived in Atlanta Georgia my entire life. In 2016 I graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelors in applied physics.
                     During college I picked up coding python as a hobby while working as an undergraduate researcher. Lately I've been working to expand my programming knowledge to languages other 
                     than python, that might actually help me get a job.<br><br>I also do a bit of photography from time to time. Most of my pictures are either of space things, birds, or from some game I 
                     was able to sneak my camera into. I put a few of them on the portfolio page.
                </p>
